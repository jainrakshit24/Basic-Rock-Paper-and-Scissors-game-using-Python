# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This program allows a user to play against the computer.

## How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter a choice: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three choices.
- The winner is determined based on the traditional rules:
  - Rock smashes Scissors â†’ Rock wins
  - Paper covers Rock â†’ Paper wins
  - Scissors cuts Paper â†’ Scissors wins
  - Same choices result in a tie
- The result is displayed to the user.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:
```sh
python --version
```

### Running the Game

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Run the script using:

## Example Output
